After cleaning this value we have divided this workflow into three different categories i.e., Data collection, Data cleaning and manipulation and EDA. As Further moved i.e Data collections first step to find different columns which is done by coding Head(), tail(), info(), describe(), columns() and some others method used for data collections. In this dataset there are both duplicate and missing values available. So we have to deal with that and as a result we have replaced the null and missing values and also removed the duplicate values.we have also added some columns.Before visualize any data from the data set we have to do data wrangling.
