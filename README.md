# Introduction
Welcome to the Hotel Booking Data Analysis project! In this project, we will explore and analyze a dataset containing booking information for two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. This dataset includes a variety of features such as booking dates, length of stay, the number of guests (adults, children, babies), and available parking spaces, among others. The goal of this project is to discover important factors that influence hotel bookings.
# Dataset Information
 - Dataset Name: Hotel Booking Dataset
 - Total Rows: 119,390
 - Total Columns: 32
 - Data Types: Object (String), Integer, and Float
 - Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and handled missing values
  
# Project Workflow
The project is divided into three main stages:

### 1. Data Collection
In this stage, we gathered relevant information about the dataset, including the structure and type of data. Key steps include:
 - Using methods like head(), tail(), info(), describe(), and columns() to understand the data.
 - Identifying duplicate values and missing data and taking steps to clean the dataset.
### 2. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
The cleaning and manipulation stage focuses on preparing the data for analysis. Key tasks include:
 - Removing duplicate values (a total of 31,994 duplicates were found).
 - Handling missing values in four columns.
 - Adding new columns if needed for analysis.
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is the heart of the project, where we visually and statistically explore the dataset to extract meaningful insights. We followed the "UBM" rule, which stands for Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis, and Multivariate analysis, to guide our data exploration.


# Conclusion
This project is a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data, and it provides insights into the factors that influence hotel bookings. The results of this analysis can be valuable for hotel management and the tourism industry. Enjoy exploring the project and feel free to reach out for any questions or feedback!

Happy analyzing!
